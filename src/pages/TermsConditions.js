              <p className="privacy-text">These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern your relationship with https://www.xpertzsoftware.com website (the "Service") operated by Xpertz Software Corp. ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

              <p className="privacy-text">Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using the Service.</p>

              <p className="privacy-text">Your access to and use of the Service is based on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.</p>

              <p className="privacy-text">By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms and accept all legal consequences. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, in whole or in part, please do not use the Service.</p>




              <h2>Subscriptions</h2>

              <p className="privacy-text">Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set on a monthly basis.</p>

              <p className="privacy-text">At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Xpertz Software Corp. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting Xpertz Software Corp. customer support team.</p>

              <p className="privacy-text">A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Xpertz Software Corp. with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize Xpertz Software Corp. to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>

              <p className="privacy-text">Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Xpertz Software Corp. will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the invoice.</p>




              <h2>Fee Changes</h2>

              <p className="privacy-text">Xpertz Software Corp., in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>

              <p className="privacy-text">Xpertz Software Corp. will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>

              <p className="privacy-text">Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>


              <h2>Refunds</h2>

              <p className="privacy-text">Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>

              <p className="privacy-text">You are responsible for safeguarding the password that you use to access the Service and for any activities or actions under your password, whether your password is with our Service or a third-party service.</p>
